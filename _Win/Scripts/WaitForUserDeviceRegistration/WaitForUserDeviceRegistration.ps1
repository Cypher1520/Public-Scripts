# Used to pause device ESP during Autopilot Hybrid Join to wait for
# the device to sucesfully register into AzureAD before continuing.
#
# Use IntuneWinAppUtil to wrap and deploy as a Windows app (Win32).
# See ReadMe.md for more information.
#
# Tip: Win32 apps only work as tracked apps in device ESP from 1903.
#
# Exits with return code 3010 to indicate a soft reboot is needed,
# which in theory it isn't, but it suited my purposes.

# Create a tag file just so Intune knows this was installed
