### What is the PowerShell App Deployment Toolkit?

The PowerShell App Deployment Toolkit provides a set of functions to perform common application deployment tasks and to interact with the user during a deployment. It simplifies the complex scripting challenges of deploying applications in the enterprise, provides a consistent deployment experience and improves installation success rates.

The PowerShell App Deployment Toolkit can be used to replace your WiseScript, VBScript and Batch wrapper scripts with one versatile, re-usable and extensible tool.

### What are the main features of the PowerShell App Deployment Toolkit?

* **Easy To Use** - Any PowerShell beginner can use the template and the functions provided with the Toolkit to perform application deployments.
* **Consistent** - Provides a consistent look and feel for all application deployments, regardless of complexity.
* **Powerful** - Provides a set of functions to perform common deployment tasks, such as installing or uninstalling multiple applications, prompting users to close apps, setting registry keys, copying files, etc.
* **User Interface** - Provides user interaction through customizable user interface dialogs boxes, progress dialogs and balloon tip notifications. Supports completely silent script execution as well.
* **Localized** - The UI is localized in several languages and more can easily be added using the XML configuration file.
* **Integration** - Integrates well with System Center Configuration Manager(SCCM); provides installation and uninstallation deployment types with options on how to handle exit codes, such as supressing reboots or returning a fast retry code. The toolkit also supports logging in CMTrace-compatible format.
* **Updatable** - The logic engine and functions are separated from per-application scripts, so that you can update the toolkit when a new version is released and maintain backwards compatibility with your deployment scripts.
* **Extensible** - The Toolkit can be easily extended to add custom scripts and functions.
* **Helpful** - The Toolkit provides detailed logging of all actions performed and even includes a graphical console to browse the help documentation for the Toolkit functions.
